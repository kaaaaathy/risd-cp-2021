  As a class, we are going to create an slack index of rewritten computer history materials.
  <br><br>
  For this 1-week assignment, find 1-3 articles/links/zines/media that you would like in a syllabus about computer history. How would we incubate a less white supremacist, patriarchal computer history?

    content:`
    Transcribe 500-750 words of any text. It must be done by you, manually. This project is less about form and more about experience + process.
    <br>
    <br>
    Consider your source text:
    <li>Is it already presented as digital, parsable text?
    <li>Is it archived as a printed or written object (or otherwise not-presently machine readable)?
    <li>How spatial is it? (e.g. a set of unrelated receipts on the table, a set of street names)
    <br>

    <br><br>
    In a few sentences in the Slack, articulate how transcription feels as a method of transformation. Note the bodily and mental experience of translation. Note the decisions you make when you are translating it. In which ways does it feel neutral, or opinionated?

    Create a text-based project with a web-based component which applies computational ingredients (i.e. chance, score, ordering) to text and optionally, imagery. This project:
    <br>
    <br>
    <li> Must be able to be read in class by another person, without instruction. (If it’s important for it to be read by you, let me know)
    <li> Must, at minimum, use randomness in some way
    <li> Must demonstrate a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and calling an array by index
    <li> You can use an existing text (i.e. a poem, piece of news, etc) or you can write your own.

    Create a project with a focus on embodiment/interface/avatar and collective voice. This project:
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Must draw a relationship between two or more pieces of text by different authors (one of them can be you)
    <li>Must be performed for the class over zoom (or you can share a recording of the performance)
    <li>Can use any medium of language expression: text, audio based, etc. Will you perform it? Will you use a voice interface other than yourself? Will it be silent?

    <b>To consider:</b> How does the embodiment of the text shift the relationship between the original text(s)? Will you reveal difference between all/both voices, or channel through a disambiguating singular body?

		content:`
    Create a new score, procedure, tool, and/or object for reading/writing. "Reading" and "writing" here can be interpreted broadly, i.e. "reading" as data collection, etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Articulate:</b><br>
    <li>Your corpus
    <li>Your methods
    <li>Mode of embodiment/performance/interface
    <br><br>
    Present the methods as a documented source with the final piece. This can be as simple as a .txt doc alongside it, or it can be embedded in the performance.
    <br><br>
    <b>Consider:</b><br>
    <li>Is the result different each time on the same text(s), or the same?
    <li>How does it behave on different texts?
    <li>Can / should this be performed through other means?

    This work can build off of one of your previous projects. Themes from class you can optionally play with if it inspires: Missing data sets. obfuscation of secrets, labor / work
